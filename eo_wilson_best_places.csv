bhutan,"This idyllic mountain nation deserves praise for the preservation of much of its native habitats and biodiversity. Its faunas and floras remain an intact slice of those that originally characterized the bulk of the Himalayan mountains and foothills. In Bhutan, 70 percent of the land is covered by forest representing the three principal zones, tropical, temperate, and alpine. The five thousand known species of plants include forty-six rhododendrons and six hundred orchids.

CubaHispaniola,The two largest islands of the Greater Antilles contain an exuberant fauna and flora that form the bulk of the biodiversity of all the West Indies.,"The two largest islands of the Greater Antilles contain an exuberant fauna and flora that form the bulk of the biodiversity of all the West Indies. Their ultimate affinity is to Central America, from which the Antillean landmass broke away by continental drift tens of millions of years ago. Their long isolation has resulted in the origin of large numbers of species that today are found nowhere else. Some, like the strange insectivore mammal Solenodon, are relicts from the islands’ earliest history. Others are the products of adaptive radiation, wherein one or a very few colonizing species have found less competition and more open niches than on the mainland. This circumstance has allowed some to proliferate into swarms of species that today individually fill the niches. Among the conspicuous examples are the diverse, abundant forms of anole lizards, and strange ants that glitter in metallic hues variously of blue and green. One day, while exploring in the Escambray Mountains of central Cuba, I found both a metallescent green ant species that nests in rock crevices and another species whose bodies flash gold foraging on low bushes. Moreover, both Cuba and the nearby Dominican Republic are surrounded by relatively undisturbed shorelines, with intact coral reefs"
Hawaii,"Its tropical climate, relatively large size, and mountainous terrain with multitudinous habitats promoted the genesis of a large diversity of land-dwelling plants and animals.","The Hawaiian archipelago, like the equally far-flung Easter, Pitcairn, and Marquesas archipelagoes, deserves mention in part for what it once was. Its tropical climate, relatively large size, and mountainous terrain with multitudinous habitats promoted the genesis of a large diversity of land-dwelling plants and animals. A high percentage of these originated as products of adaptive radiations. Dramatic examples of such species swarms include the honeycreepers among the smaller birds, tree crickets among the insects, and lobelias among the flowering plants. The beautiful assemblage has been largely wiped out or pushed into the remote uplands of the central mountains by agricultural conversion and semiwild gardens of invasive species. Perversely, the latter have become a poster child for the “novel ecosystems” celebrated by Anthropocene supporters."
Myanmar,"The northern reaches of this still-seldom-visited country harbor four reserves, about thirty-one thousand square kilometers in combined area, and a rich fauna that includes elephants, bears, red pandas, tigers, and gibbons. This region includes tropical forests, coniferous woodland, and even patches of arctic grasslands above tree line.

GhatsIndia,"The Western Ghats, a mountain range running parallel to the full length of the west coast, are the geological spine of India. Their range of elevation, from near sea level to 2695 meters at the highest point, and their tropical location combine to create a great variety of terrestrial habitats, and with them a high level of biodiversity.

Homeward bound, he noticed that mockingbirds differ from one island to the next, causing him to conceive of evolution.

Its rate of discharge is eleven times that of the Mississippi River and sixty times that of the Nile. Its dimensions, when all of the tributaries are added, are matched by an immense diversity of fish and other freshwater animals and plants.
